This is the repository for my master thesis entitled _Live Introspection For
Neural Network Training_. It motivates, introduces and uses the [`ikkuna`
library](https://github.com/Peltarion/ai_ikkuna) for monitoring neural network
training.

The thesis document is located at `thesis_latex/Thesis.pdf`.
