\chapter{Appendix A --- Open Source Acknowledgments}
\label{ch:appendixA}

The following presents a non-exhaustive list of open source tools used in
creating the software, experiments and this document:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \LaTeX{} for typesetting this document \citep{lamport}. This includes contributions by
        the creators of all the packages which make up the typesetting
        environment.
    \item The various GNU and thrid-party command line tools (\texttt{grep}, \texttt{parallel}
        \citep{tange_ole_2018_1146014}, \texttt{latexmk} etc.)
    \item The Ubuntu operating system and the Linux kernel
        \citep{torvalds2008linux} providing the
        computational environment for the experiments conducted for this work,
        alongside the GNU compiler toolchain for compiling software
        for the system
    \item The TMUX and SSH tools for connecting to the system running the
        experiments
    \item The PyTorch \citep{paszke2017automatic}, Numpy, TensorBoard and
        Matplotlib libraries \citep{scipy} used for the
        software, based all on the Python programming language and standard
        library.
    \item The Sacred \citep{sacred}, MongoDB and Pymongo libraries used for logging experiments
        to a database for later visualisation
    \item The Vim editor and associated plugin ecosystem employed for creating
        all documents, be it code or documentation
    \item The Git source control management tool which was used to version both
        software and documentation artifacts
\end{enumerate}
