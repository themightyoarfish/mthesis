\chapter{Experiments in live introspection}

This chapter serves the purpose of showcasing the library and validating its
usefulness for actual deep learning research. While the ultimate goal is to have
a set of well-researched metrics in place which can be used live during
training, the way to acquire these metrics requires extensive analysis from many
experiments. Therefore, the goal of this work is to obtain such metrics, not
actually use them. This entails that the library is used primarily for easily
gathering all the data from the necessary experiments, and not for supervising
the actual training.

The chapter is divided between a reproduction part (see
\cref{sec:optimization_validation}) and an original research part (see
\cref{sec:detecting_learning_rate_proprocess} and
\cref{sec:detecting_layer_saturation}). In the former, experiments are conducted
for two popular variations of gradient descent are reproduced and extended with
the help of the library. The goal is to fact-check claims made by the authors
and validate said claims on more scenarios than are shown in the respective
publications. This will serve to show how \texttt{ikkuna} could have been
employed for this type of work. The second part will be concerned with employing
the library to investigate hypotheses for diagnosing roadblocks in the training
proprocess. Recall from \cref{sec:motivation} the multitude of hyperparameters
for a deep learning model and training regimen. In this work, we will concern
ourselves with the question of figuring out a good learning rate and when to
stop training layers to reduce computation time.

This thesis is not concerned with advancing the state of the art in
classification. Instead, toy problems are developed in order to prove or
disprove that the proposed metrics have the potential to be useful in guiding
the training. A more thorough evaluation of the results on realistic
architectures and problem sizes would require significantly more time and
computational resources and is left for future work.

\section{Experimental Methodology}%
\label{sec:experimental_methodology}

For all experiments, \texttt{ikkuna} is used for recording various metrics
during training without having to adapt to any specific model. Experiments are
run on a Google Cloud virtual instance with $4$ Intel Xeon CPUs and Nvidia Tesla
K80 graphics cards with 11gb of video memory. The information captured by
\texttt{ikkuna} during training is logged to a MongoDB schemaless database with
the help of the \texttt{sacred} library. The data can then be analysed off-line
with MongoDB's Python interface. Plots are created with \texttt{matplotlib} and
\texttt{seaborn}.

\section{Detecting Learning Rate Problems}%
\label{sec:detecting_learning_rate_problems}

\subsection{Ratio-Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduling}%
\label{sub:ratio_adaptive_learning_rate_scheduling}

The first problem to be investigated is that of choosing an appropriate learning
rated. We begin with a brief review of gradient descent and then evaluate how
the update-to-weight ratio of model weights can be used to identify bad learning
rates or automate learning rate selection.

In standard stochastic gradient descent, a loss $J$ of some the
model parameters $\boldsymbol\theta$ (here, the layer weights) is computed over the training set of $m$
examples by forming the expectation over the sample loss $L$:

\begin{align}
    J(\boldsymbol\theta) &= \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x},y\sim\hat{p}_{\text{data}}} L(\mathbf{x}, y, \boldsymbol\theta) \\
                         &= \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}L(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}, \boldsymbol\theta)
\end{align}
The cumulative loss can then be derived for $\boldsymbol\theta$

\begin{align}
    \nabla_{\boldsymbol\theta}J &= \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\nabla_{\boldsymbol\theta}L(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}, \boldsymbol\theta)
\end{align}
per the sum rule of differentiation. The simplest form of parameter update rule
is then

\begin{align}
    \boldsymbol\theta &\leftarrow \boldsymbol\theta - \eta \nabla_{\boldsymbol\theta}J
\end{align}
with the learning rate $\eta$. There is no hard and fast rule on what this
parameter should be, and it is subject of large swathes of literature. Popular
modifications to the vanilla update rule are the use of momentum
\citep{jacobs1988increased}, per-layer learning rates (ibd.), reducing the rate
throughout training, or adapting the
learning rate based on mean and variance of gradients across past time steps
\citep{kingma2014adam}. Nevertheless, most of the time, training begins with an
arbitrarily chosen small learning rate around $0.01$ which is then adapded
either by the aforementioned mechanisms or by search over the parameter space on
a subset of the training data when computationally feasible.

As a first hypothesis, we investigate a claim made by \citet{karpathycs231n} who
states that the ratio between updates and weights is a quantity which should be
monitored and constrained. He suggests a target of $\frac{1}{t} = 10^{-3}$ as a
reasonable value, but to the author's knowledge there has never been a thorough
investigation of this hypothesis. Because of this lack of exploration and the
celebrity of the proponent, this merits further investigation.

It seems intuitive that this target cannot be static throughout training, since
we usually decay the learning rate towards the end, leading to smaller magnitude
of updates (this is a prerequisite for theoretical convergence guarantees for
SGD, see \citet[p. 20]{saad1998online}). It is also not clear whether the target
should apply to all layers equally. For instance, in networks with the (now
outdated) tanh activation function, the later layer's gradients are larger as
fewer backpropagation steps have been done to them, and for this activation
function at least, each application of the chain rule entails mutliplication
with a factor $< 1$ (as the tanh derivative never exceeds $1$ and decreases to
almost $0$ in both limtis), so gradients become exponentially small. In fact,
the vanishing gradient problem was the main driver to introduce non-saturating
activation functions.  Other nonlinearites such as the rectified linear unit do
not exhibit the same behaviour, but that does not mean all layers must change at
the same rate.

As a first approach to an evaluation, we want to try and select the learning
rate in such a way as to hit the target postulated by
\citeauthor{karpathycs231n}.

The experimental setup uses the simplified AlexNet architecture
(\cref{sec:pack-models}) shown in \cref{fig:alexnetmini}. The dataset used is
the well-known CIFAR-10 dataset consisting of $60.000$ $32\times32$ colour images
from ten object categories \citep{krizhevsky2009learning}. The opimisation
alogrithm used is plain stochastic gradient descent on minibatches of size $128$. The
dataset does not constitute a hard problem to solve; state of the art accuracies
lie around $95\%$. For this reason, a descision must be made about how to make
the problem hard enough so that improvements to the training schedule can
actually be made. The learning rate has thus been fixed to a high value of $0.2$
which is not the optimal value (a learning rate of $0.1$ solves the problem to
$45\%$ accuracy).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{gfx/diagrams/neural_network/alexnetmini.pdf}
    \caption[Simplified AlexNet architecture]{The network used in this
    experiment. Image features are extracted by $4$ and $8$ convolutional
    filters, respectively, with ReLU nonlinearities. Maximum pooling is applied
    with a filter and stride size of $2$ leading to a resolution a fourth of the
    original size. The classifier portion employs dropout layers to reduce
    co-adaptation of units and a final softmax activation to map outputs to
    class probabilities in $(0,1)$.}
    \label{fig:alexnetmini}
\end{figure}

In order to validate that there is room for improvement (i.e.~the task is not
too easy), the training has been
run about twenty times for both a constant learning rate and an exponentially
decaying rate according to
\begin{equation}
    \eta_{e+1}  = 0.98^{e+1} \eta_{e},
\end{equation}
$e$ being the epoch index.
The final accuracies after $100$ epochs of training for constant learning rate,
exponential decay are shown in \cref{fig:validation1}. As can be seen, there is
a significant improvement when decaying the learning rate over keeping it
constant.

    ratio schedule is discussed in\cref{sec:ratio-schedule}}
    \label{fig:validation1}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{The Adaptive Update-to-Weight-Ratio Schedule}\label{sec:ratio-schedule}%

As a first showcase of the library and a test of the update-weight ratio
hypothesis, an adaptive learning rate based on the aforementioned ratio is
implemented with the help of the library.  We will start by formally describing
the update rule and then show how it is implemented with \texttt{ikkuna}.

Let $l$ be the number of layers with weight matrices associated with them (for
instance linear or convolutional layers, but not activation functions, dropout,
or the like). Let $\left\{W_{i,k} \mid i = 0 \ldots l - 1\right\}$ be the set of weight
matrices at training step $k$.  Let $\eta$ be the base learning rate and
$\frac{1}{t}$ be a target value to which we want the update-to-weigh ratio to
move. Furthermore, let $\gamma \in (0, 1)$ be a decay factor for exponential
smoothing.  Now, let

\begin{equation}
    R_{i,k} = \frac{||W_{i,k} - W_{i,k-1}||_2}{||W_{i,k}||_2}
\end{equation}
be the ratio between the $L2$-Norms of layer $i$'s weight updates before step $k$ step
and the weights at step $k$ themselves.  We then select the new learning rate
for batch step $k+1$ as

\begin{align}
    \eta_{k+1}   = \eta_{k}
                   \left(
                   t \cdot \frac{1}{l}
                   \sum_{i=0}^{l-1} \gamma R_k + (1 - \gamma) R_{k-1}
                   \right)^{-1}
\end{align}
for $k \ge 2$.  This is the average exponentially smoothed update-weight-ratio,
divided by the target range. This learning rate is used for vanilla gradient
descent without any other modifications beyond capping it to some value in case
of very small ratios. The effect of adapting the learning rate according to this
schedule is that the average ratio between the weight updates and the weights
moves towards the target range.  It should be noted that this update rule biases
the learning rate in favour of the smaller layers since all ratios are weighted
equally, regardless of the number of weights.
\cref{fig:schedule-accuracies} displays a set of accuracy traces for each of the
schedules (constant, exponential decay, ratio-adaptive) with different base
learning rates. The network was trained from scratch $5$ times for each combination.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{gfx/diagrams/experiments/ratio_adaptive_accuracies.pdf}
    \caption[Accuracy traces for different schedules on CIFAR10]{Accuracy traces
    for different schedules on CIFAR10. Batch size and initial learning rate are
    shown above each subplot. The exponential decay schedule uses a decay factor of
    $0.98$. Chance level is $0.1$. The experiments are run for $100$ epochs
    each.}
    \label{fig:schedule-accuracies}
\end{figure}

The results are not overwhelming, which is unsurprising for such a
simple schedule. For the smaller learning rates, it is not better or worse than
a constant or exponentially decaying schedule. However, for unnecessarily high
learning rates, the adaptive schedule outperforms the constant one, hinting at a
possible signal for identifying too high learning rates. This holds for the
smaller of the three batch sizes, which makes sense as a high batch size is
generally more amenable to a high learning rate, as the larger sample size
reduces the noise in the gradient and makes for a smoother loss landscape as the
gradients for more samples are averaged. On the other hand, the adaptive schedule
is also better than a constant one for very small learning rates on large batch
sizes. So it not only works in preventing too-high learning rates, but also too
low ones. This signal could hence be useful for
identifying inappropriate learning rates in small or large batch sizes.

As an impression of how the library presented in \cref{ikkuna} simplifies a
general implementation of such a learning rate schedule, code is provided here.

When an \verb+Exporter+ is configured for a given model, a
\verb+RatioSubscriber+ (see \cref{tbl:subscribers}) must be added to the message
bus in order for the update-weight-ratio ($R_{i,k}$ in the above equations) to be
published. One can then subscribe them and process the information with this
subscriber:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
class RatioLRSubscriber(PlotSubscriber):
    def __init__(self, base_lr, smoothing=0.9, target=1e-3, max_factor=500):
        subscription = Subscription(self, ['weight_updates_weights_ratio', 'batch_started'],
                                    tag=None, subsample=1)
        super().__init__([subscription], get_default_bus(),
                         {'title': 'learning_rate',
                          'ylabel': 'Adjusted learning rate',
                          'ylims': None,
                          'xlabel': 'Train step'})
        # exponential moving avg of R_{i,k}
        self._ratios     = defaultdict(float)
        # maximum multiplier for base learning rate (in pathological cases)
        self._max_factor = max_factor
        # exp smoothing factor
        self._smoothing  = smoothing
        # target ratio
        self._target     = target
        # this factor is always returned to the learning rate scheduler
        self._factor     = 1
        self._base_lr    = base_lr

    def _compute_lr_multiplier(self):
        '''Compute learning rate multiplicative. Will output 1 for the first batch since no layer
        ratios have been recorded yet. Will also output 1 if the average ratio is close to 0.
        Will clip the factor to some max limit'''

        n_layers = len(self._ratios)
        if n_layers == 0:   # before first batch
            return 1
        else:
            mean_ratio = sum(ratio for ratio in self._ratios.values()) / n_layers
            # prevent numerical issues and keep current LR in that case
            if mean_ratio <=  1e-9:
                return 1
            else:
                factor = self._target / mean_ratio
                return min(factor, self._max_factor)

    # invoked by the runtime for each incoming message
    def compute(self, message):
        if message.kind == 'weight_updates_weights_ratio':
            # the `key` property for these messages will be the module/layer
            # here we compute the exponential moving average of ratios
            i               = message.key
            R_ik            = message.data
            R_ik_1          = self._ratios[i]
            gamma           = self._smoothing
            self._ratios[i] = gamma * R_ik + (1 - gamma) * R_ik_1
        elif message-kind == 'batch_started':
            # before a batch starts, update the lr multiplier
            self._factor = self._compute_lr_multiplier()

    def __call__(self, epoch):
        return self._factor
\end{lstlisting}

The subscriber implements the \verb+__call__()+ method so it can be dropped into
PyTorch's learning rate scheduler (\verb+torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LambdaLR+).
This learning rate schedule can thus be used in every model, without modification.


\subsection{Effects Of Update-to-Weight-Ratio On Training Loss}%
\label{sub:effects_update_to_weight_ratio_on_training_loss}

We have seen in the previous section that at least for pathological cases the UW
ratio can be used to correct the learning rate to some extent. In this section,
we want to examine how this ratio does or should change during training. As
discussed in \cref{sub:ratio_adaptive_learning_rate_scheduling}, it is unlikely
that a constantly high rate of change to the weights will be beneficial
throughout the entire training. We would therefore like to find a relation
between the loss decrease, the current UW ratio and the point in time during
training. This could help us improve the learning rate schedule developed above
and refine the use of the UW ratio as a signal for inappropriate learning rates.

For this experiment, we learn CIFAR-10 for $75$ epochs, again with a batch size
of $128$, with vanilla SGD and different learning rates. We use the AlexNetMini
architecture again, as well as a larger, more powerful VGG network (schema in
\cref{fig:vgg16}). We employ \verb+ikkuna+ to record losses, accuracies and UW
ratios for each layer automatically during training. In order to mage larger
trends visible, we smooth the loss trace with a gaussian kernel.

\subsubsection*{VGG}

In \cref{fig:ratio_loss_corr_vgg_sgd_001,fig:ratio_loss_corr_vgg_sgd_005,fig:ratio_loss_corr_vgg_sgd_01}
we plot the loss traces and their inverse derivative (the amount of decrease) in
the upper right, the average weight-update ratio in the lower right, and a
scatterplot of ratio versus loss decrease on the left.
