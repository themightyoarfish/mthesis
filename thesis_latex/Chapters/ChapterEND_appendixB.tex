\chapter{Appendix B --- Contributions to other libraries}\label{ch:appendixB}

This appendix lists all code and documentation contributions made to other projects during
development.

        Project              & Contribution                                                  \tabularnewline

        Matplotlib           & Added a note to the official documentation about the API
                               for \texttt{errorbar} (commit hash
                               \texttt{3a698d6e7d972d2c18fe4d2524e92ff637326f88})            \tabularnewline
        PyTorch              & Added a document to the official documentation detailing
                               how to make experiments reproducible (see
                               \url{https://pytorch.org/docs/master/notes/randomness.html}).
                               The note has been modified since creation.                    \tabularnewline
        CuPy                 & Added NumPy-style ordering and comparison
                               functionality
                               for complex number types, thereby enabling all sorts of operations for
                               complex matrices which did not work previously. This required
                               modifications to the C++ code backing the library and the glue code
                               generating the Python interface. Relevant commits are
                               \texttt{6f92c30a6e41a7cd512f17f6a32302f0b8d0970d},
                               \texttt{55d504e4183c271c640d566d8691f763d6276af5},
