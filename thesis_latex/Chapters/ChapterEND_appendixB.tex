        Project      & Contribution \tabularnewline
        \midrule
        PyTorch      & Added a document to the official documentation which discusses how to make training runs reproducible when running on the GPU. \tabularnewline
        CuPy         & Added NumPy-style ordering and comparison functionality for complex number types, thereby enabling all sorts of operations for complex matrices which did not work previously. \tabularnewline
        TensorBoardX & Documentation improvements
