        PyTorch      & Added a document to the official documentation detailing how to make experiments reproducible (see \url{https://pytorch.org/docs/master/notes/randomness.html}).  \tabularnewline
        CuPy         & Added NumPy-style ordering and comparison functionality for complex number types, thereby enabling all sorts of operations for complex matrices which did not work previously. \tabularnewline
        TensorBoardX & Documentation improvements \tabularnewline
